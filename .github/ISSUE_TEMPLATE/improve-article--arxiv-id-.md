**Problem details**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
 - is the article missing pieces of content (a section, an abstract, references?)
 - are there latex constructs missing support (marked in red), or supported inaccurately?

For example: 
> Labels are missing their targets, and conversion fails abruptly.
